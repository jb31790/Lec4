## Task 1: Basic CSS Styling
 - Using the knowledge from Lectures 2 and 3 on HTML structures and semantics, create an HTML page about your favorite hobby. Use CSS to style the page with colors, typography, and backgrounds. Ensure the page is visually appealing.

## Task 2: Advanced Selectors
 - Design an HTML page that has multiple sections, each with a different class and ID. Using CSS, style each section differently using both class and ID selectors. Experiment with different selector modifiers to achieve varied styling effects.

## Task 3: Color Themes
 - Create an HTML page that presents three different themes (e.g., dark mode, light mode, and colorful). Use named colors, hex values, and RGB(A) to define the color themes. Allow the user to switch between these themes using buttons.
